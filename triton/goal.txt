so the idea for triton is that it makes parallel processing blockalized. I think it has the advantages of combining the matrix multiplications and parallelism. So every program has to be designed in this philosophy.

here is my systematic theory

structural advantages:
1. combinations of both optimization
2. C++ fashion more control

features:
how does GPU works from the moment the trition program runs to the moment it finishes

triton will compile the file into PTX(virtual machine instruction set architecture) then it will generate binary code base on the PTX assembly and cubin binary.

The compilation stages: Triton IR, Triton GPU IR, LLVM IR, PTX and finally cubnin binary .
GPU memory hiearchy consists of global memory, L1 / L2 caches, shared memory,registers and specialized memories

Pytorch, Numpy and triton will do the broadcasting for tensor add or minus with scalar
